## Summary
Based on the analysis, there doesn't seem like it was any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program because the data shows that percentage of the unpaid 5-star reviews were higher than the paid 5-star reviews.

An additional analysis that I would recommend is to separate the data into training and testing sets in order to evaluate the dataset. By doing this, you can minimize the effects of data discrepancies and better understand the characteristics of the model.
